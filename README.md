- Data warehousing solutions for efficient storage and retrieval
- End-to-end ETL pipeline for data processing

## 💻 Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of technologies, including:

- **Data Warehousing:** MSSQL for data storage
- **ETL:** Efficient extraction, transformation, and loading of data
- **Data Visualization:** Tableau for creating interactive dashboards
- **Containerization:** Docker for consistent development environments

## 🌐 Data Flow

The data flow within this project follows a systematic approach. It starts with data collection, followed by transformation and analysis, leading to visualization. Below is a simplified overview of the data flow:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather data from various sources
2. **Data Cleaning:** Remove inconsistencies and prepare for analysis
3. **Data Transformation:** Convert data into a usable format
4. **Data Analysis:** Perform analytical tasks to derive insights
5. **Data Visualization:** Present insights through visual formats

## 🔍 Data Analysis Techniques

In this project, we applied several data analysis techniques:

- **Descriptive Analysis:** Summarize historical data to understand trends
- **Predictive Analysis:** Use statistical models to predict future outcomes
- **Prescriptive Analysis:** Recommend actions based on analysis

## 📈 Data Visualization

Data visualization plays a critical role in conveying insights effectively. We used Tableau to create interactive dashboards, allowing users to explore data intuitively. Here are some key visualizations included in the project:

- Sales trends over time
- Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior
- Promotional campaign performance metrics
